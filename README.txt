In this project, we implement SOLID principles using Java language. 
SOLID stands for :
	- S : Single Responsability Principle
	- O : Open/Closed Principle
	- L : Liskov Principle
	- I : Interface 
	- D : Dependency Inversion
	
	
	
Open/closed Principle :
"Software entities (classes, methods, functions..) should be open for extension, but closed for modification".
